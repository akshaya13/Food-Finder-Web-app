The Foodfinder is a web based application that allows you to find out
the recipes based on your choices. The application filters recipes to
check for dishes that contain common allergens, such as wheat,
dairy, eggs, soy, nuts, etc., and also determine whether a recipe is
vegan, vegetarian, Paleo friendly, Whole30 compliant, and more. It
also fetches food with the nutritional information that satisfy users'
dietary goals. If needed, the application provides the recipe card for
the selected food.
